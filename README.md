| Platform              | File                                  | Notes                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `Project Manager-{version}-arm64.dmg` | Open DMG, drag to Applications. First launch: right-click → Open to bypass Gatekeeper.   |
| Windows (x64)         | `Project Manager Setup {version}.exe` | NSIS installer. SmartScreen may warn on first launch — click "More info" → "Run anyway". |

The app runs a local server on port 3000 and stores data in the OS-standard app data directory. No account, no cloud — everything stays on your machine.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 (see `.nvmrc`)

## Development Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run seed    # creates data/db.json with sample projects/tasks
npm run dev     # starts on http://localhost:3000
```

### Desktop App (Electron)

```bash
npm run electron:build      # Next.js build + Electron compile
npm run electron:dev        # Run in Electron (requires build first)
npm run electron:dev:open   # Fast: opens Electron pointing at dev server (no build)
npm run electron:dist       # Full distributable for current platform
npm run electron:dist:mac   # macOS DMG (arm64)
npm run electron:dist:win   # Windows NSIS installer (x64)
```

### Code Quality

```bash
npm run lint            # ESLint (Next.js rules)
npm run lint:fix        # ESLint with auto-fix
npm run format          # Prettier format all files
npm run format:check    # Prettier check (CI)
```

Pre-commit hooks (Husky + lint-staged) auto-format and lint staged files.

### Testing

```bash
npm test                # Unit + API tests (Vitest)
npm run test:watch      # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage   # With coverage report
npm run test:e2e        # E2E tests (Playwright, starts dev server)
npm run test:e2e:ui     # E2E with Playwright UI
npm run test:all        # Unit + E2E
```

## Features

### Project Management

- **Kanban board** with 4 columns (To Do, In Progress, Blocked, Done)
- **Drag-and-drop** projects between columns and reorder within columns
- **Full CRUD** — create, edit, delete projects and tasks from the UI
- **Priority levels** (P0–P3) with color-coded badges
- **Task timers** with start/stop/toggle and accumulated time tracking
- **Due dates** with overdue/today/soon visual indicators
- **Progress bars** showing completed tasks per project
- **Task checklists** — subtask checklists on each task with add, toggle, edit, and delete
- **Search** across project titles, task titles, descriptions, and labels
- **Sort** by manual order, priority, date, or name
- **Activity log** tracking all changes
- **Keyboard shortcuts** (press `?` to see them, hint pulse on first visit)
- **Project detail modal** with tasks, progress, and activity

### Studio Lighting

Supports three fixture types via CRMX wireless DMX through a Litepanels Apollo Bridge:

- **Litepanels Astra Bi-Color Soft** — 2-channel (intensity + CCT, 3200–5600K)
- **Aputure Infinimat 2×4** — 4-channel Profile 2 (intensity, CCT, ±green/magenta tint, strobe; 2000–10000K)
- **Aputure Infinibar PB12** — 8-channel Mode 1 (intensity, CCT, color mix, R/G/B, effect, speed; 2000–10000K, RGB-capable)

**Color control:**

- **CCT mode** — Kelvin slider with quick presets (Tungsten, Halogen, Fluorescent, Daylight, Overcast, Shade) and gel presets (Full/Half/Quarter CTO and CTB), auto-filtered to fixture range
- **HSI mode** — Canvas-based circular hue wheel with inner saturation gradient (RGB-capable lights)
- **RGB mode** — Per-channel sliders (0–255) with filled color gradients (RGB-capable lights)

**Mixer and control:**

- **Grand Master fader** — Global intensity multiplier (0–100%) in the toolbar, applied to all dimmer channels in real time
- **±Green/Magenta tint** — Per-light tint correction for the Infinimat (−100 to +100)
- **Light groups** — Organize lights into named groups (e.g., Key, Fill) with collapsible headers, count badges, and group-level ON/PARTIAL/OFF power toggle
- **Compact/expanded view** — Toggle between full LightCard panels and a compact single-row view per light

**Effects engine (server-side, 30fps):**

- **Pulse** — Sine-wave intensity oscillation
- **Strobe** — Hard on/off toggling
- **Candle** — Layered random flicker
- Speed control (1–10, mapping to 0.5–5Hz) per light

**Scenes:**

- Save and recall lighting presets across all lights
- **Fade recall** with configurable duration (Instant / 1s / 2s / 3s / 5s) — server-side interpolation with ease-in-out curve
- Visual scene cards with color swatch strips and click-to-rename
- "Update" button to overwrite a scene with current light states

**Monitoring and reliability:**

- **DMX Output Monitor** — Toggleable sidebar panel showing real-time DMX channel values grouped by fixture, with bar visualization and channel labels (polls every 500ms)
- **Bridge reachability detection** — TCP probe shows connection status in the toolbar (green/red) and per-light "No Signal" badges
- **Auto-init on open** — sACN sender initializes and syncs all fixture states when the Lighting view is opened; no manual setup step required
- **DMX blackout on quit** — lights gracefully turn off when closing the app

**Setup Wizard:**

- Multi-step first-run wizard guides through Apollo Bridge setup, CRMX pairing (tabbed per fixture type), DMX address assignment (with overlap detection), and Stream Deck configuration
- Branches based on use case: PM-only (4 steps) or PM + Lighting (9 steps)

### Stream Deck+ Integration

- **Context-aware action API** — dials cycle selection, buttons act on current project/task/light
- **Three-page layout** — Projects, Tasks, and Lights pages
- **4 rotary encoders in light mode** — Dial 1 = intensity, Dial 2 = CCT, Dial 3 = Red (RGB) or ±G/M tint (Infinimat), Dial 4 = Green/Blue (press to cycle, RGB only)
- **LCD strip feedback** — Companion polls for real-time display data

### Platform & Reliability

- **Real-time SSE** with auto-reconnect and exponential backoff
- **Atomic writes** — data file is never partially written
- **Auto-backups** every 30 minutes with automatic corruption recovery
- **Timer crash recovery** — running timers survive unexpected shutdowns
- **Splash screen** — Electron shows a loading screen during startup
- **Window state persistence** — remembers size, position, and maximized state
- **Accessible modals** with focus trapping, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation
- **Unsaved changes warning** on form modals
- **Toast notifications** with accessibility, stacking limit, and error-specific timeouts
- **Error and 404 pages** matching the dark theme

All routes use origin-validated CORS via `getCorsHeaders(req)` from `lib/cors.ts`, restricting access to `localhost` origins.

## Stream Deck+ Setup with Bitfocus Companion

### Prerequisites

1. Download and install [Bitfocus Companion](https://bitfocus.io/companion)
2. Connect your Stream Deck+ in Companion's settings
3. Ensure the dashboard is running on `http://localhost:3000`

### Concept: Context-Aware Actions

Rather than mapping each project to a fixed button (which doesn't scale), the deck uses a **server-side selection context**. Rotary dials cycle through projects/tasks, and buttons act on whatever is currently selected. All buttons POST to a single URL (`/api/deck/action`) with a static JSON body.

### Companion Configuration

For every button below, create an HTTP action in Companion:

- **Method:** `POST`
- **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/deck/action`
- **Header:** `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Body:** as shown in the table

### LCD Strip Feedback

Configure Companion to poll `GET http://localhost:3000/api/deck/lcd` (project mode) or `/api/deck/light-lcd` (light mode) every 1–2 seconds. The response includes display data for each LCD key, which can be shown on the Stream Deck+ LCD strip via Companion's variable system. `/api/deck/context` provides the current selection state.

## Data

`data/db.json` is gitignored. Re-create it any time with `npm run seed`.

## Architecture

- **SSE:** `GET /api/events` keeps a `ReadableStream` open per client. All mutation routes emit on a `globalThis` `EventEmitter`; the SSE route listens on it. Client re-fetches `/api/projects` on each event. Auto-reconnects with exponential backoff (1s → 10s cap).
- **Concurrency:** `mutateDB()` chains writes through a `globalThis` promise mutex — concurrent Stream Deck presses serialize safely. Chain survives write errors.
- **Data safety:** Atomic writes (tmp + rename), auto-backups every 30 min, corruption recovery from backups, timer crash recovery on startup.
- **Timer display:** Stored as `totalSeconds` + `lastStarted` ISO timestamp. The `Timer` component computes live elapsed via `setInterval` — no server writes while running. Crash recovery adds elapsed time on next startup.
- **Drag-and-drop:** Uses `@hello-pangea/dnd` for cross-column status changes and within-column reordering.
- **DMX lighting:** `lib/dmx.ts` manages a singleton sACN Sender on `globalThis`. Real-time slider drags use in-memory `dmxLiveState` + throttled sACN sends (no disk writes); final values persist to `db.json` on slider release. Bridge reachability is checked via TCP probe to port 80 — `ECONNREFUSED` counts as reachable (host is up, port closed). Grand Master is applied as a multiplier on all dimmer channels in `sendDmxFrame()`.
- **Effects engine:** `lib/effects.ts` runs per-light effects (Pulse/Strobe/Candle) server-side on a `globalThis` interval at 30fps. Speed 1–10 maps to 0.5–5Hz.
- **Scene fades:** Server-side interpolation in `lib/dmx.ts` (`startFade()`) at ~30fps with ease-in-out curve. Persists final values on completion.
- **Deck context:** Server-side `selectedProjectId` in settings — dials cycle it, buttons act on it. Companion polls `/api/deck/context` and `/api/deck/lcd` for LCD feedback. Light mode uses `/api/deck/light-action`, `/api/deck/dial`, and `/api/deck/light-lcd`.
- **Desktop app:** Electron wraps a standalone Next.js server via `utilityProcess`. Shows splash screen during startup. Persists window size/position. Sends DMX blackout on quit. On macOS, closing the window keeps the server alive (dock icon). On Windows, a system tray icon keeps the process alive — closing the window hides to tray; "Quit" from the tray context menu exits cleanly.
- **Modals:** Shared `<Modal>` component provides focus trapping, ARIA attributes, and focus restoration. Form modals track dirty state and confirm before discarding.
- **CI/CD:** Push/PR to `main` runs lint, format check, build, unit tests, and E2E tests (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Pushing a `v*` tag builds macOS and Windows distributables and creates a GitHub release (`.github/workflows/release.yml`).
